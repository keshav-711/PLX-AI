#PLX‑AI: A Modular Multi‑Agent AI System
PLX‑AI is a next‑generation, modular, multi‑agent AI system designed to be scalable, extensible, and easy to understand.
Inspired by real-world agent architectures and futuristic AI assistants, PLX‑AI is built with clarity, structure, and long‑term growth in mind.
This project is being developed as part of my BE CSE (AI/ML) journey — with the goal of understanding every component deeply and building a real, production‑style AI system from scratch.
